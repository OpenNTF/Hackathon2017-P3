# Social Notifier: Send To Watson Workspace

### Brief Description

Domino DDM sends an alert to Watson Workspace, which triggers subsequent notifications, including to Slack, and to other platforms as desired, including Twitter etc.

### Actors

Notifications wonâ€™t be user generated, these will be automated based on time interval DDM lookups.

### Preconditions

Project has to be configured in the IBM Domino and Watson environments:

##### Watson Workspace Configuration

- Create an account on Watson Workspace
- Create a Workspace for the team
    - Find out the '**Space id**' which is the part of the URL when your are in your space: 
      - `https://workspace.ibm.com/space/<space-id>`
- Create an Application on Watson Workspace
    - Go to https://developer.watsonwork.ibm.com/apps/
    - Click '*Create new app*' 
    - Note your '**App ID**' and '**App secret**'  and keep them secure.
- Add the new app into your space.
    - Go to your space settings
    - In Apps, you will see your newly created application.
    - Click '*Add to space*'.


##### IBM Domino environment configuration:

- Create a new NSF configuration database for every different workspace.
  - Use [NTF template](_deploy/snotifier.ntf) provided.
  - Open the new database created and click '*Create\config*' to create the configuration
  - Fill in the fields for '*Space Id*', '*AppId*' and '*AppKey*' from the previous steps.
  - Save and exit
- Add notes.ini setting for configuration document(s)
  - On Domino server, add a new notes.ini parameter named `DT_Databases` listing configuration database file names.
  - Multiple databases can be listed using delimiter `;` 
    - e.g. DT_Databases=tools\team1alert.nsf;tools\team2alert.nsf
- Add Plugin to your Domino server
  - Make sure you have IBM Domino 9.0.x environment with OpenSocial Component installed (needed for DOTS)
  - Download the recent JAR file [from the '_deploy' folder](_deploy/) and save it into the following folder on your Domino server;
    - *{Domino Data Folder}*\domino\workspace-dots\applications\eclipse\plugins
  - If DOTS is not running, add DOTS to `ServerTasks` parameter in the notes.ini file. 


##### Usage

Now you can use event handlers on Monitoring Configurations

- Select '**Log to a database**' as a notification method
- Database file name will be the NSF file names you defined in the previous steps.
